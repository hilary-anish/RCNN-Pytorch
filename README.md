<h2> RCNN - Pytorch framework (using VGG-16 pretrained model) </h2>


<h4> About Dataset </h4> Various aerial images of Airplanes <br>
<h4> Object Detector </h4> RCNN <br>
<h4> About Dataset: </h4>

<p> While I was trying to learn and understand RCNN, most of the python codes were in Tensorflow-Keras Framework <br>
So, I have made some effort to utilize the underlying concepts of RCNN architecture and develop my own <br>
RCNN object detector in pytorch framework
</p>

<h4> Further Developments </h4>
<p>
Though the results are good, they are not consistent, this could be improvised by an additional <br>
SVM layer at the end along with a linear regression for the bounding boxes</p>
